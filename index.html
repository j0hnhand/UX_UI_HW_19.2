                    <h2>Hi,</h2>
                    <h1>I'm John, UX/UI Researcher and Designer.</h1>
                    <p>I’m a UX/UI professional specializing in user 
                        research that delivers impactful insights. 
                    Employing an empathetic approach to understand users and their needs. 
                    Solving complex user problems through clean, minimal designs and 
                    communicating insights across multiple teams to create unique solutions. 
                    Tools include Figma, Adobe XD, Miro, and InVision. My background in 
                    anthropology has given me experience in ethnographic research and 
                    cultural sensitivities. Thriving independently or within small teams. 
                    Previously worked with the US Forest Service in a research role and at The Clean 
                    Program as Director of Experience, now seeking full-time roles remotely or in-person.

                            I create surveys, design, carry out and synthesize interviews, 
                            and perform usability tests to understand users and their needs.

                        <p>I try to understand users from their own perspective, 
                            as well as from an objective perspective. 
                            I gauge their technological competency, 
                            products and brands they use, and where they casually “hang out” online.

                        <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
                        <p>I use interviews to gather qualitative data about 
                            participants’ background, home life, interests, 
                            personality,  disposition, likes, and pain points. 
                            This helps inform user personas and enhance the
